# SudokuSolver
Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle where the objective is to fill a square grid of size 'n' with numbers between 1 to 'n'. The numbers must be placed so that each column, each row, and each of the sub-grids (if any) contains all of the numbers from 1 to 'n'. Sudoku Solver solves the given Sudoku completely.
